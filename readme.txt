A filter that displays 360-degree panoramas taken with Photo Sphere.

== Description ==

WP Photo Sphere is a filter that allows you to display 360-degree panoramas taken with Photo Sphere, the camera mode
brought by Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. With WP Photo Sphere, your visitors will be able to navigate through your panoramas
without install any plugin.

WP Photo Sphere is based on Photosphere, a JavaScript library written by Joe Simpson (kennydude):

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add a panorama? =

1. Upload your panorama like any file and copy its ID.
2. Insert the tag `[sphere id]` and replace 'id' with the ID copied at step 1 (for example: `[sphere 42]`).

= How to change the dimensions? =

By default, the dimensions are 560 x 315 pixels but you can change that in the options page (in the Settings menu).

You can also choose different dimensions for each panorama using the attributes width and height.
For example: `[sphere 42 width="200" height="400"]`.

= Is it possible to autostart the panorama? =

Since the version 1.1, you can specify, for each panorama, a special attribute: `autostart`. If you use this attribute,
the panorama will start automatically after the page has loaded. This attribute doesn't require any value, for example:
`[sphere 42 autostart]` or `[sphere 42 width="300" height="150" autostart]`.
