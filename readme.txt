A filter that displays 360-degree panoramas taken with Photo Sphere.

== Description ==

WP Photo Sphere is a filter that allows you to display 360-degree panoramas taken with Photo Sphere, the camera mode
brought by Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. With WP Photo Sphere, your visitors will be able to navigate through your panoramas
without install any plugin.

WP Photo Sphere is based on the JavaScript library [Photo Sphere Viewer](http://jeremyheleine.me/#photo-sphere-viewer).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-photo-sphere` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add a panorama? =

Use the `Add a panorama` button to upload or choose a panorama to insert into your post.

= How to change the dimensions? =

By default, the dimensions are 560 x 315 pixels but you can change that in the options page (in the Settings menu).

You can also choose different dimensions for each panorama using the width and height attributes.
For example: `[sphere 42 width="200" height="400"]` or `[sphere 42 width="50%" height="300"]`.

A maximum width can also be given with the attribute max_width. Its default value can be changed in the options page.

= Can I change the automatic animation? =

By default, panoramas are automatically animated after 2000 milliseconds, but you can change this with the
anim_after attribute. You can also deactivate the animation with the value -1. For example:
`[sphere 42 anim_after="5000"]` or `[sphere 42 anim_after="-1"]`.

You can set the animation speed with the anim_speed attribute. It accepts six units: revolutions per minute/second
(rpm/rps), degrees per minute/second (dpm/dps) or radians per minute/second (rad per minute/second). The default
speed can be set in the options page.
Example: `[sphere 42 anim_speed="10rpm"]`.

= Is it possible to autoload the panorama? =

Since the version 1.1, you can specify, for each panorama, a special attribute: `autoload`. If you use this attribute,
the panorama will start automatically after the page has loaded. This attribute doesn't require any value, for
example: `[sphere 42 autoload]` or `[sphere 42 width="300" height="150" autoload]`.
